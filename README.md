### 🔍 AI-Powered Multi-Modal Fake News Detection System

Detect fake news using **Raw Text**, **News Articles**, **Online News URLs**, or **Images** with an intelligent evidence verification pipeline.

</div>

---

# 📖 Overview

The Fake News Detection System is an AI-powered web application that helps users identify whether a piece of news is **Real** or **Fake**.

Unlike traditional fake news classifiers, this system first verifies information using trusted evidence sources before using a deep learning model.

The application accepts multiple input formats:

- 📝 Raw text
- 📰 News article
- 🔗 Online news URL
- 🖼️ Image containing news

---

# ✨ Features

✅ Detect fake news from raw text

✅ Detect fake news from copied news articles

✅ Detect fake news from online news links

✅ Detect fake news from uploaded images

✅ OCR-based text extraction from images

✅ Evidence verification layer

✅ Deep Learning (LSTM + CNN)

✅ User-friendly React interface

✅ Fast prediction
